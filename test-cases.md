# Test Cases

## Basic Tests

### 1.1 Add New Profile

- **Context**: A new profile is published to the index.
- **Expected Result**: The new profile should appear in the updated profiles list.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Publish a new profile to the index.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Confirm the new profile appears in the updated profiles list.

### 1.2 Update Existing Profile

- **Context**: An existing profile is updated in the index (e.g., change a field).
- **Expected Result**: The updated profile should appear in the updated profiles list.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Update an existing profile in the index (e.g., change the name or description).
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Confirm the profile appears in the updated profiles list with the new data.

### 1.3 Delete Profile

- **Context**: A profile is marked as deleted in the index.
- **Expected Result**: The profile should appear in the deleted profiles list.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Mark a profile as deleted in the index.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Confirm the profile appears in the deleted profiles list.

## Authority Transitions

### 2.1 From AP to NAP (Authorized -> Not Authorized)

- **Context**: The domain owner built the website using a WordPress plugin themselves, rather than through `test-tools`.
- **Expected Result**:
  - `hasAuthority` should be updated to `0`
  - If `status !== 'ignore'` and `isAvailable === 1`, the profile should be added to `unauthorizedProfiles`
  - `status` should be changed to `'ignore'` automatically
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Add a profile to `test-tools` website.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Add the same profile to self-built WordPress site (AP).
  4. Verify the first profile appears in `unauthorizedProfiles` with `status = 'ignore'`.

### 2.2 From NAP to AP (Not Authorized -> Authorized)

- **Context**: The profile is moved back to an authorized domain. For example: self-built WordPress is removed, and the `test-tools` becomes authorized.
- **Expected Result**:
  - `hasAuthority` should be updated to `1`
  - `status` should remain unchanged (manual editing required)
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Remove the profile from self-built WordPress site.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Confirm the profile from `test-tools` has `hasAuthority = 1` again.

### 2.3 Unavailable prorfile revalidated

- **Context**: Re-checking profiles if the profile is not available.
- **Expected Result**: The profile should should update in the background.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Temporarily make the WordPress website unavailable.
  2. Create a new cluster to get the profiles.
  3. Confirm the profile is unavailble in the list.
  4. Make the site available again.
  5. Update the cluster.
  6. Go to `Edit Node` page and see the profile becomes available.

## Profile State Edge Cases

### 3.1 Deleted in index, not present locally

- **Context**: A profile marked as deleted is returned from the index, but not present locally.
- **Expected Result**: Skipped silently with no error or updates.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Simulate a deleted profile in index that's missing locally.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Verify no error is shown, and nothing is deleted.

### 3.2 New profile from a NAP domain

- **Context**: A new profile is published on a domain without authority.
- **Expected Result**:
  - Should show up in the updated List with `hasAuthority = 0`
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Publish a profile on a domain like `test-tool`.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Verify it appears in `profileList` with `hasAuthority = 0`

### 3.3 New profile from an AP domain

- **Context**: A new profile from an authorized domain.
- **Expected Result**:
  - Profile is added to `profileList`
  - Unauthroized profiles should show up in the unauthorized profile list.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Publish a profile on a selft-built WordPress domain.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Verify it appears in `profileList` with `hasAuthority = 1`, and unauthroized profiles should show up in the unauthorized profile list.

## Timestamp Synchronization

### 4.1 Same timestamp â€“ no update

- **Context**: `last_updated` timestamp matches the last trigger time.
- **Expected Result**: Update the last_updated after click the `Update Node` button.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Record the current last_updated timestamp.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Confirm last_updated is applied and shown in the cluster list.

## Error and Empty Response Handling

### 5.1 API Error Handling

- **Context**: Simulate an API error in `fetchProfiles`, `updateNode`, or `deleteNode`.
- **Expected Result**:
  - Error is caught
  - Toast displays the error
  - Flow continues without crashing
- **Test Steps**
  1. Change the URL of index_url in the cluster.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Check the errors show up in the toast.
  4. Confirm that the user is redirected to the home page.

### 5.2 No updates returned

- **Context**: No updates, deleted, or unauthorized profiles are returned.
- **Expected Result**:
  - Toast message: `"No updated profiles found."`
  - User is redirected to `/`
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Ensure there are no new, deleted, or unauthorized profiles in the index service.
  2. Update the cluster.
  3. Check toast message appears: `No updated profiles found`.
  4. Confirm that the user is redirected to the home page.
